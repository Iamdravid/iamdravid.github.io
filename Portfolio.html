		<h2>My Portfolio</h2>
		
			<p> Before coming to devCodeCamp I work in retail. I'm only 19 but I've had three jobs in retail already.
			My first job was at Pick n' Save the grocery store. I was there for only a month and decided to leave because the working conditons and the overall environment was horrible.<img src="pns.jpg" alt="me" style="float:right;width:150px;height:150px;">
			</p><br>
			
			<strong><p1>My second job was at OfficeMax, I was what they called a "Technology Specialst" and spent most of the time helping customers on either buying computer, fixing the computer, if they had questions on computers. I was pretty much like the utility guy at OfficeMax because even though I was in the tech department I also did cashier, print center, frieght, e.t.c.</p1></strong><br><br><img src="om.png" alt="me" style="float:left;width:200px;height:150px;">
			
			<strong><p1>My third job was at The Home Depot. I was called a flooring specialst in their business, I worked with customers who wanted new flooring. Since the Decor department was small the flooring team did that as well. I pretty much new a lot about tile, carpet, laminate, wood, carpet and window blinds. After 6 month there I decided it wasnt really worth it and came to devCodeCamp.</p1></strong><img src="hd.jpg" alt="me" style="float:right;width:250px;height:250px;">
